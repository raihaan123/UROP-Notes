# Research Objectives
### Aim
> Investigate the accuracy of PINNs in solving ODEs using well-known numerical test cases (for instance, the [[Van der Pol Oscillator]])

This will require optimizing the hyperparameters of the network to minimise errors. We (mostly me lol) want to design a PINN solver to beat the current state of the art and to further investigate the shortcomings of the architecture. There will probably involve some error quantification and if time allows, an investigation into 'hybrid solvers'...
