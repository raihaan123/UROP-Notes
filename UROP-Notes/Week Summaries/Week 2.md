#### Contents
- Studying the [[DeepXDE]] paper by Lulu et al.
- Structure of the PINN solver


## Outline
Compared to the rapid progress of last week, week 2 was pretty uneventful - mostly literature review! A lot of work has gone into building PINN solvers for PDE problems and it is worth understanding what has been explored previously.

A popular implementation of PINNs are in 

## Summary of DeepXDE
[[DeepXDE]] is a highly configurable Python framework for solving PDE systems using PINNs, providing the classes and methods to define, configure and train models easily.
